# flask
Flask app with React Front end

Useful tutorial that requires switching to Yarn from Bower: https://realpython.com/the-ultimate-flask-front-end/

Later I intend to Dockerize the app for deployment to Digital Ocean: https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-a-dockerized-flask-app-to-google-cloud-platform-71d91b39b25e

# Basic Commands

To run in development, before `flask run` type `export FLASK_ENV=development` to default to development server
